# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: whoan/docker-build-with-cache-action@v5

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Start postgres server
        run: cp docker-compose-postgres.yml ../docker-compose.yml && cd .. && docker-compose  up -d

      - name: Build our code
        run: docker build -t a-gnucash-integration:$CIRCLE_BRANCH .
    
      - name: Run executable
        run: docker run --net=host a-gnucash-integration:$CIRCLE_BRANC ./a-gnucash-integrationH
